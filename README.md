# freecodecamp-project
# Here I am again with a beginner project assigned by freecodecamp.org
# It's a little Tacos shop website with some little CSS (I am still learning )
# The main page of the website is the one corresponding to index.html
 # You will find also in the main page two external pages : the first one is the page called "hours.html" which provides info about the store hours, and the second one called "contact.html" which gives  the user the chance to contact the store .
